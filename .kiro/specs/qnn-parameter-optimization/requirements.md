# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The hybrid quantum neural network (QNN) model currently exceeds the parameter limit constraint by 837,914 parameters (887,914 total vs 50,000 limit). This feature focuses on optimizing the model architecture to meet all competition constraints while maintaining or improving classification performance on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a quantum AI competition participant, I want to reduce the total model parameters to under 50,000, so that my submission meets the competition constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model is initialized THEN the total parameter count SHALL be less than or equal to 50,000
2. WHEN parameter counting is performed THEN each component (CNN backbone, quantum preprocessor, quantum circuit, quantum postprocessor, fusion classifier, ensemble head) SHALL report accurate parameter counts
3. WHEN the model is trained THEN it SHALL maintain the existing quantum parameter count of 56 (within 8-60 limit)
4. WHEN the model is evaluated THEN the circuit depth SHALL remain at or below 30
5. WHEN the model processes input THEN it SHALL continue to use exactly 8 qubits

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to systematically reduce parameters in each model component, so that I can identify the most effective optimization strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the CNN backbone THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities to reduce the 257,856 parameters
2. WHEN analyzing the quantum preprocessor THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities to reduce the 534,272 parameters
3. WHEN analyzing the quantum postprocessor THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities to reduce the 3,056 parameters
4. WHEN analyzing the fusion classifier THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities to reduce the 81,281 parameters
5. WHEN analyzing the ensemble head THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities to reduce the 11,393 parameters
6. WHEN optimizations are applied THEN each component SHALL maintain its functional purpose

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a machine learning practitioner, I want to preserve model performance during parameter reduction, so that the optimized model remains competitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model is optimized THEN the classification accuracy SHALL not decrease by more than 5% from the baseline
2. WHEN training the optimized model THEN the convergence behavior SHALL remain stable
3. WHEN evaluating on Fashion-MNIST THEN the model SHALL maintain balanced performance across all 10 classes
4. WHEN comparing models THEN the optimized version SHALL demonstrate similar or better training efficiency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quantum computing researcher, I want to maintain the hybrid quantum-classical architecture integrity, so that the quantum advantages are preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model processes data THEN the quantum circuit SHALL continue to perform meaningful quantum operations
2. WHEN quantum preprocessing occurs THEN the dimensionality reduction SHALL preserve relevant features
3. WHEN quantum postprocessing occurs THEN the quantum state information SHALL be effectively extracted
4. WHEN classical and quantum components interact THEN the fusion mechanism SHALL remain effective

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a competition participant, I want automated constraint verification, so that I can quickly validate my model meets all requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model is instantiated THEN the system SHALL automatically verify all parameter constraints
2. WHEN constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with specific violation details
3. WHEN constraints are met THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation with detailed parameter breakdown
4. WHEN running verification THEN the system SHALL check total parameters, quantum parameters, circuit depth, and qubit count
5. WHEN verification completes THEN the system SHALL generate a compliance report
